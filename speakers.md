					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<h4>Innovative Standards for a New Web</h4>
					<p>Complementing the conference theme of "a new web", this talk focuses on standards opportunities and challenges for the new web.  After all, we certainly need to sustain the principle of interoperability that forms of the foundation of today's web. This talk explores new standards needs for the new web.  Some of these relate to social needs of the web: security, privacy, internationalization, and accessibility.  Others relate to the richness of the web: apps, immersive, highly interactive, data frameworks.  Finally, others relate to e-commerce needs that are driving new requirements on the web.</p>

				<div class="biography">
					<p>Sandro Hawke is a W3C Fellow at MIT leading the Credible Web (credweb.org) activity to develop consensus data schemas which promote trust on the Web. For many years at W3C he helped develop standard technologies for data sharing and interop, including RDF, OWL, SPARQL, and JSON-LD. He also led MIT's Crosscloud project with Tim Berners-Lee, developing technologies for practical decentralization. He likes coding in modern JavaScript, especially in NodeJS, and still uses emacs.

					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<h4>Building a Credible Web — Fighting Misinformation with a Data Ecosystem</h4>
					<p>In recent years, the global threat of disinformation attacks (eg in elections) and more passive misinformation dangers (eg around vaccines) has become clear. The W3C Credible Web Community Group has been examining what technology can do to help.</p>

					<p>We frame the problem in the Web context like this: the user, at their browser, needs to decide how much to trust online content. Various systems can help with the frequent mental credibility assessments, including the website being visited, any intermediate sites (news feeds, search engines), and the browser itself. These systems can give the user more information and cross-validate information, as well as analyze it and output the results, or even act on the user’s behalf to block very-low-credibility content.</p>

					<p>The group’s work is largely in understanding what kind of data might signal high or low credibility and helping that signal data be generated and exchanged in a partially-open data ecosystem.  This talk will describe the group’s results so far and its strategy going forward with an eye toward how people can get involved.</p>

					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<h4>FIDO2: A Web Without Passwords</h4>
					<p>A web without passwords is within reach thanks to a new FIDO2 standards. FIDO2 open standards, developed by the FIDO Alliance in partnership with W3C, allow the consumer electronics industry to build support for easy-to-use, phishing-resistant FIDO authentication directly into their products and platforms. Including the passwordless and second-factor use cases from first generation standards FIDO U2F and FIDO UAF, FIDO2 provides the end-to-end interoperability between devices and online services needed to finally put us past the “shared secret” model of authentication for good.</p>
					<p>Andrew Shikiar of FIDO Alliance will provide an overview of the FIDO2 vision and where adoption is to date, including the status of three critical pieces needed for adoption at scale: browser and platform support; supporting products and certification programs; and rollout by online services. While passwords will be around for a while, attendees will come away from this session understanding why and how they will begin to disappear.</p>
