					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<h4>Innovative Standards for a New Web</h4>
					<p>Complementing the conference theme of "a new web", this talk focuses on standards opportunities and challenges for the new web.  After all, we certainly need to sustain the principle of interoperability that forms of the foundation of today's web. This talk explores new standards needs for the new web.  Some of these relate to social needs of the web: security, privacy, internationalization, and accessibility.  Others relate to the richness of the web: apps, immersive, highly interactive, data frameworks.  Finally, others relate to e-commerce needs that are driving new requirements on the web.</p>

					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<h4>Houdini: The Future of CSS</h4>
					<p>CSS has produced many wonderful abilities for web developers, but it's always been limited strictly to what the CSS Working Group defined for it. Web authors have been very clever in remixing those abilities to achieve wonderful things, but it's still fundamentally limiting. "Houdini" is the project in the CSSWG to make CSS extensible via JavaScript, so that authors can define their own functionality, within CSS, without waiting for us in the CSSWG. This talk will cover the current Houdini specs being implemented and shipped <b>today</b>, and give a glimpse of what's coming in the future.</p>

					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<h4>WebAuthn: Strong, Usable and Standardized Authentication</h4>
					<p>The W3C WebAuthn API enables websites to preform strong, phishing resistant authentication through trusted devices owned by the user. It allows for the incorporation of new authentication factors, such as device possession and biometrics, whether they are additional factors in multi-factor flows or components of entirely passwordless flows.</p>
					<p>In this talk we'll do an overview of the API and its companion FIDO specifications, focusing on the use cases they enable. We'll also consider some lessons learned through their adoption at Google, look towards the future of the spec implementation and leave open questions for what's next.</p>

					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<h4>Brave, Privacy and Standards</h4>
					<p>Web standards play a large role in deciding how private the web can be. A standards process that holds privacy as a core value can help protect web users from privacy violations, and can strengthen interest in the web as a first-tier application platform.  Unfortunately, the current standards process falls short of this goal.</p>
					<p>In this talk, I'll discuss why privacy is important at Brave, and some places where web standards have made privacy difficult.  The talk will give concrete examples of standards (new and old) that make web privacy difficult,
as well as identify common "anti-patterns" in standards work that frustrate privacy improvements. I end with three suggestions for changes in the standardization process that would improve web privacy.</p>

					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<h4>Building a Credible Web — Fighting Misinformation with a Data Ecosystem</h4>
					<p>In recent years, the global threat of disinformation attacks (e.g. in elections) and more passive misinformation dangers (e.g. around vaccines) has become clear. The W3C Credible Web Community Group has been examining what technology and standards can do to help.</p>
					<p>We frame the problem in the Web context like this: the user, at their browser, needs to decide how much to trust online content. Various systems can help with the frequent mental credibility assessments: the website being visited, any intermediate sites (news feeds, search engines), and the browser itself. These systems can give the user more information and cross-validate information, as well as analyze it and output the results.</p>
					<p>The group's work is largely in understanding what kind of data might signal high or low credibility and helping that signal data be generated and exchanged in a partially-open data ecosystem. This talk will describe the group's results so far and its strategy going forward with an eye toward how people can get involved.</p>

					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<h4>FIDO2: A Web Without Passwords</h4>
					<p>A web without passwords is within reach thanks to a new FIDO2 standards. FIDO2 open standards, developed by the FIDO Alliance in partnership with W3C, allow the consumer electronics industry to build support for easy-to-use, phishing-resistant FIDO authentication directly into their products and platforms. Including the passwordless and second-factor use cases from first generation standards FIDO U2F and FIDO UAF, FIDO2 provides the end-to-end interoperability between devices and online services needed to finally put us past the “shared secret” model of authentication for good.</p>
					<p>Andrew Shikiar of FIDO Alliance will provide an overview of the FIDO2 vision and where adoption is to date, including the status of three critical pieces needed for adoption at scale: browser and platform support; supporting products and certification programs; and rollout by online services. While passwords will be around for a while, attendees will come away from this session understanding why and how they will begin to disappear.</p>

					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<h4>MiniApp & Web</h4>
					<p>Mini App as a new form of application has been raising quickly in the Internet market in countries like China. Leveraging the advantages of both Web application and native application, Mini Apps run on the platforms of certain super native applications with Web standards as some basic elements. As the Mini App market grows, better compatibility, interoperability and development efficiency are needed by the industry. And standardization of the Mini App technologies can be an effective solution. Also, a Mini App ecosystem based on standards might trigger another round of innovation for Web, since Mini App itself has the good potential to be another powerful carrier for the Web content. Mini App scenarios, use cases, standards requirements and thoughts of the future of Mini App and Web will be presented accordingly.</p>

					<h4>Graph Data: RDF, Property Graphs</h4>
					<p>W3C held <a href="https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/">a workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data</a> in March 2019, in Berlin, Germany. The workshop focussed on different areas: what role do Property Graphs play and how do they relate to RDF;  and what are the possible changes, improvements, etc, that are necessary for RDF  to make it better suited for Graph Data in general. This presentation will give a quick overview of what happened at the Workshop and what the future plans are at W3C to address the relevant issues.</p>

					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<h4>Web-based Knowledge Extensions</h4>
					<p>Knowledge bases, such as YAGO, DBpedia and Freebase, have seen explosive growth in many application domains. As most of knowledge bases are extracted from human-edited knowledge sources, the data integrity therein is hardly guaranteed and the information contained in the knowledge bases is expected to be far from complete. This makes <b>knowledge extention</b> a particularly important task. In addition, these existing knowledge bases contain sparse linkage connectivity, which poses severe challenge to link prediction between entities. To cope with such data sparsity issues, one needs to leverage model with low complexity to avoid overfitting the weak structural information in the graphs, requiring the simple model efficiently encode the entities and their description information and then effectively decode their relationships. In this talk, we will introduce our recent proposed knowledge extention techniques, which have improved the knowledge extention performances on real-world knowledge base datasets, and then discuss the challenges of existing web standards when facing this knowledge extension, schema merging and knowledge based applications.</p>
